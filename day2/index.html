          <h2>Chief Adviser of Bangladesh</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Dr. Muhammad Yunus often</b> hailed as the "Father of
            Microfinance," is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, economist, and
            Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Born on June 28, 1940, he is best known
            for founding Grameen Bank in 1983, an institution that
            revolutionized banking by providing microloans to impoverished
            individuals, particularly women, who lacked access to traditional
            financial services. Dr. Yunus's pioneering work in microfinance has
            empowered millions of people to lift themselves out of poverty by
            fostering entrepreneurship and financial independence. His
            innovative approach challenged conventional banking systems and
            highlighted the potential of social business to address global
            poverty. In 2006, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, alongside
            Grameen Bank, for their efforts to create economic and social
            development from below. Dr. Yunus continues to be a prominent
            advocate for social justice, economic empowerment, and the role of
            businesses in solving social problems.
